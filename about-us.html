            <h2 class="about-left">About Picnic Lifestyle</h2>
            <p class="about-txt">Picnic Lifestyle was founded by Eva Simone in 2020 during the height of the first lockdown. She had been placed on furlough and tried to find some calm and joy through her art and jewellery making. After a short while, she started sharing her creations on her <span class="span-link"><a class="span-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/velvetknitter" target="_blank">Instagram</a></span> and gained a dedicated following. By August of 2020 Eva was made redundant, and so decided to leap headfirst into turning her hobby into her full time job. 
            <br> Picnic Lifestyle took off quickly and was soon bringing in enough work to allow Eva to start renting her own studio workshop, where she was able to expand her team and her offerings. Two years and an even bigger studio later, we're here today to provide you with stunning handmade jewellery to celebrate your individuality! </p>

            <h2 class="about-right">About the team</h2>
            <p class="team-txt">Today our fabulous team consists of 7 wonderful women who all share the same passion for the feel-good power of wearing jewellery you love.

We're proud to be a certified <span><a class="span-link" href="https://www.livingwage.org.uk/" target="_blank">Living Wage Employer</a></span> and are delighted that we get to share the talents of our wonderful staff every day. <br>As a group we love doing annual retreats and workshops, just like the festive wreath workshop we all did last Christmas!</p>

            <h2 class="future-left2">About the future</h2>
            <p class="future-txt">Every year in business brings us closer to new and exciting developments! Our hopes for 2023 are to be able to expand our product offerings to include handmade items from other small crafters from around the world, ensuring that everyone is paid fairly for their skills and time. <br>If 2020 taught us all anything, it's that it's impossible to know with any certainty what the future holds. That said, we really hope that one day in the future we'll be able to open our very own flagship store. Be sure to sign up for our newsletter the be the first to hear of any developments on this front!</p>
